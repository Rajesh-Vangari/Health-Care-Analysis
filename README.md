# Health-Care-Analysis


Health Analysis Project

Welcome to my Health Analysis project, where I utilize data analysis and visualization techniques to derive insights from healthcare data using Power BI. üìäüè•

Project Overview

In the healthcare sector, understanding patient demographics, treatment costs, and satisfaction levels is essential for improving service delivery and patient outcomes. This project aims to provide a detailed analysis of healthcare metrics, facilitating data-driven decisions for healthcare providers. Here‚Äôs a summary of my work:

1. Data Collection & Preparation
   
Data Sources: I collected data from various healthcare databases, including patient demographics, visit records, treatment costs, and satisfaction scores.

Data Cleaning: The raw data was meticulously cleaned to ensure accuracy, address missing values, and standardize formats, laying the groundwork for effective analysis.

2. SQL for Data Analysis
3. 
I leveraged SQL to efficiently analyze the healthcare data, focusing on:

Retrieving Relevant Data: Extracting patient visit records for specific time periods to identify trends in patient behavior.

Calculating Treatment Costs: Aggregating average treatment costs by department, which informs resource allocation and budget planning.

Analyzing Patient Satisfaction: Examining satisfaction scores by age group to tailor services and improve patient care.

Tracking Trends: Monitoring monthly patient visits to understand healthcare usage patterns.

3. Dynamic Power BI Dashboard
 
Interactive Features: I developed a user-friendly Power BI dashboard with buttons and navigation, allowing users to explore various metrics easily.

Key Metrics Visualization: The dashboard highlights essential health metrics, such as total patient visits, average treatment costs, and patient satisfaction trends.

Custom Filters: Dynamic filters enable users to drill down into data segments based on demographics and treatment types, making insights more relevant and actionable.

5. Insights & Analysis
   
The dashboard reveals valuable insights into patient trends, treatment costs, and satisfaction levels, helping healthcare providers make informed decisions. By analyzing provider performance, this project also identifies best practices and areas for improvement in service delivery.
